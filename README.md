# csv_parser

WiP!

This was created with create-react-app, and as such has the same commands you would use for that.
To run in development mode, use `npm run start`

BIG TODO:
* figure out how to reset sort and filters when you open a csv.

TODO:
* Select Every Row when you click the Row #
* Select Every Column when you click the Column label
* Fix the weird split that cells make sometimes when scrolling
* Add an X button to remove the Explore Menu
* Slide cursor across menu options to toggle menu options
* update javascript event before redux updates (timeout probably)

ANY COLUMN:
Range, Count
NUM COLUMN:
mean, standard deviation,
